# CO2 Emissions Worldwide
Our visualization displays levels of CO2 intensity (CO2 emissions per economic output) by country by year from 1960 to 2010.

# Running Instructions
Download the files to a folder and run index.html (though not through Chrome since it won't load in the data).

# Story Board
We started off thinking of a way of viewing carbon emissions by country. We thought that a map would be a good way of displaying information by country in a way that makes geographic patterns transparent. The time dimension for this data is important, so we wanted to display the data across different time periods as well.

There are also other variables which are important for analyzing this data, so we elected to display these variables when hovering over the country. Trying to show more in the base display would be too overwhelming.
